	<p>
		Multiplication is one of the first arithmetic operations we usually learn. If you were asked to multiply two whole numbers, say \(3\) and \(5\), you could probably quickly answer \(3 \times 5 = 15\) without much thought. Given two bigger numbers, say \(11\) and \(17\), maybe it would take you a bit longer but soon enough you could surely calculate their product as \(11 \times 17=187\). With even bigger numbers like \(293\) and \(587\) you may want some pen and paper or the help of a trusty calculator to arrive at \(293 \times 587 = 171,991\).
	</p>
	  <br> 
	  <p>
		As numbers get bigger it gets harder and takes longer for us mere humans to multiply them, but computers have no difficulty in calculating their product easily and quickly. After all, performing big number-crunching tasks seems to be what computers are designed to do, and so its not surprising that computers can serve as efficient multiplying machines. 
	</p>
	
	<br>

	<p>
		Instead of multiplying two numbers, consider the reverse problem of <b>factoring</b> a number where you are given a single whole number, say 21, and asked to find two other whole numbers \(a\) and \(b\), called <b>factors</b>, which when multiplied give \(a\times b = 21\). It might be quite obvious that \(a=3\) and \(b=7\) do the trick, but what if you were given a much bigger number like \(526,301\). Then its not so immediately obvious that \(617\times 853=526,301\).
	</p>
	 <br>
	 <p>
		Of course, since \(1\times N = N\) every natural number \(N\) always has at least two <b>trivial factors</b>, namely \(1\) and the number \(N\) itself. We essentially get these two trivial factors without having to do any work, and so this factorization isn't very interesting. 
		</p>
	  <br>  
	  <p>
		Numbers that have no other factors besides the trivial ones are called </b>prime numbers</b>, and only admit  the single possible factorization of \(1\times N = N\). For example, the first few prime numbers are: \(2, 3, 5, 7\), and \(11\). If a number isn't prime then its called a <b>composite number</b>, and must have some nontrivial factors.
		</p>
	  <br>  
	  
		<p>Although a factor of a number need not be prime, it is a fundamental property that every composite number can be factored into the product of some prime numbers. In this sense, the prime numbers are the smallest building blocks of numbers through which any composite number can be formed as the product of some prime numbers. </p>
	  


<h4>Question:</h4>
<p>
What are all the non-trivial factors of \(24\)? 
</p>

<h4>Answers:</h4>
<ol>
 <li>1 and 24</li> 
 <li>2 and 3</li>
 <li>2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12</li>
</ol>
</p>

<div class="vspace"></div>

<h4>Explanation:</h4>

<p>
A prime decomposition of \(24\) can be expressed as
\( 24=2\times 2\times 3\times 3.\)
The product of any combination of the primes that appear in this decomposition yields a possible factor. Besides the two trivial factors \(1\) and \(24\), these are:
<br>
\[
\begin{align*}
2 & \\
3 & \\
4 &= 2\times 2 \\
6 &= 2\times 3  \\
9 &= 3\times 3 \\
12 &= 2\times 2\times 3
\end{align*}
\]

			<p>Any factor of a number \(N\) has the property that it divides \(N\) without leaving any remainder. This means we can verify if some number \(a\) is actually a factor of \(N\) by checking if the quantity \(\frac{N}{a}\) is a whole number or not. If so, then \(a\) is indeed a factor. Otherwise, \(a\) is not a factor since \(\frac{N}{a}\) would be a fraction which is not a whole number. </p>
			<br> 
			<p>This insight provides us with a straightforward way of finding all the factors of a number. All we have to do is find the numbers less than \(N\) that divide \(N\) without leaving a remainder. Finding one such factor \(a\) in this way comes with the bonus of determining another factor, \(b=\frac{N}{a}\), which may be different from \(a\). Because of this factor pairing, we don't actually have to try dividing \(N\) by every number less than \(N\) in our search for the factors.</p>
			<br> 
		
			<h4>Question:</h4>

			<p>How many  trial divisions of \(N\) by some number \(a\) may need to be tested to determine all possible factors of \(N\)?  </p>
		
		
		
			<h4>Answers: </h4>
		<ol>
			<li>at least \(\frac{N}{2}\)</li>
		
			<li>at most \(\sqrt{N}\)</li>
		
			<li>at least \(N\) </li>
		</ol>
		
		<div class="vspace"></div>

			<h4> Explanation: </h4>
		
			<p>Any possible factorization can be expressed as \(N=a\times b\), and it must always be the case that at least one of these factors is less than \(\sqrt{N}\). To see why the factor pairs cannot both be greater than \(\sqrt{N}\), let's suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(a\) and \(b\) are valid factors pairs but yet both \(a,b > \sqrt{N}.\) Then \(a\times b > \sqrt{N}\times\sqrt{N}=N\), but since \(a\) and \(b\) are assumed to be valid factors of \(N\) this contradicts \(a\times b = N\).</p>
			<br> 
			<p>Therefore, in order to determine all the factors of \(N \) through trial division we only have to test all whole numbers in the range \(1\leq a \leq \sqrt{N}\) and take note of the pairs \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b=\frac{N}{a}\) is a whole number. Since there are at most \(\sqrt{N}\) whole numbers in this range, the total number of trial divisions we might have to try would be at most \(\sqrt{N}\). </p>

    For relatively small numbers \(N\), our brute force strategy of simply testing every number less than \(\sqrt{N}\) by trial division may not take too long. After all, its quick and easy for computers to calculate a single trial division, but our main concern is how many such trial divisions we would need to perform in general. We've observed that as our number \(N\) to factor gets bigger, the number of trial divisions that we may need to test grows as \(\sqrt{N}\). 
	</p>
    <br> 
	<p>
			This strategy doesn't require many extra steps if the number \(N\) gets only a bit bigger, say \(N=124\) compared to \(N=145\). But what if we tried to factor a number that has even more digits, like \(N=124\) compared to \(N=14,524\). A general \(n\) digit number \(N\) can be as big as \(10^n\). Each additional digit that a number has allows the magnitude of that number to grow up to a factor of \(10\), which is an exponential scaling in the number of digits of \(N\)!
	</p>
    <br> 

    <h4>Question:</h4>

    <p>In terms of the number of digits \(n\) that a number \(N\) has, how many trial divisions of \(N\) by some number \(a\) may need to be tested to determine all possible factors of \(N\)?   </p>  
</p>

<br>

    <h4>Answers:</h4>
	
    <ol>
        <li>at least \(\frac{10^n}{2}\)</li>
        <li>at most \(10^{\frac{n}{2}}\)</li>
        <li> at least \(10^n\)</li>
    </ol>

	<div class="vspace"></div>
    <h4>Explanation:</h4>
<p>
    We know that it takes up to \(\sqrt{N}\) trial divisions to determine the factors of \(N\), and since \(N\) can be as big as \(10^n\) in terms of the number of digits \(n\), the total number of trial divisions could be as big as \(\sqrt{10^n}=10^{\frac{n}{2}}\).    
</p>

		<p>Our brute force attempt at finding factors scales exponentially as \(10^{\frac{n}{2}}\) in terms of the number of digits \(n\). This implies that merely increasing the number of digits by \(2\) could make factoring that number up to \(10\) times harder, and increasing the digits by \(4\) makes it \(100\) times harder!</p>
		<br> 
		<p>Our naive brute-force algorithm which desperately tries to find factors by testing all the possibilities isn't efficient at all. Using this method in practice, a \(100\) digit number would take an impractically long time to factor on a modern classical computer, and for a \(1000\) digit number-- don't bet on it! </p>
		<br> 
		<p>Surely there ought to be a quicker way to factor any number no matter how big, right? Unfortunately, throughout history Mathematicians and Computer Scientists have struggled to find fast factoring algorithms for classical computers, and all they have been able to come up with are algorithms that don't perform much better than our algorithm developed here. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Even though it is possible to factor any number in principle, classical computers just don't seem to be very efficient at the task. This puts the factoring problem in stark contrast with the much easier task of multiplying numbers, which classical computers quickly solve. </p>
		<br> 
		<p>This sort of one-way, easy compute is exploited for many ubiquitous cryptographic tasks in the real world. Information can be made secure by encoding a message using a large public number computed by multiplying certain private numbers. Decoding the message requires knowing the secret factors, and those holding the secret rest assured that anyone trying to decode the message by finding the factors with a classical computer will have a really long and tough time finding them.</p>
		<br> 
		<p>In 1994, Peter Shor shocked the world with the discovery of an algorithm designed for a quantum computer that can efficiently solve the factoring problem way faster than any known classical algorithms. More specifically, Shor's algorithm offers an exponential speed up compared to any known classical algorithms!</p>
		<br> 
		<p>Shor's algorithm in an incredible feat which highlights the profound power that quantum computers have to offer. This is not only exciting, but also alarming since a large-scale working quantum computer would entail serious risk to many of societies cryptographic protocols. </p>
